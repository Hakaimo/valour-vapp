# Programming languages

## what is a programming language

programming languages simply a way to tell computers what to do

## are they hard?

a lot of them, not too much. and Vapp was created specially for being very easy

## how do i program in vapp?

vapp is very simple to install and use you just need (insert how to install the electron part) then use the vapp shell for running the code.    

## what is a shell? is there an animal too?

No, there is no animals. shell is a name of the language interface

## So, after this little explanation, lets talk about how programming in vapp works:

in vapp there are 4 basic things:

* variables
* if statements
* loops
* and functions

and their concepts are very simple:

### variables

a variable is like a box with a tag, where you can put stuff and remember it later.

variable tags are just the variable name (for example MyVar)
and the box value (the stuff in there) can be (in vapp) 4 things:

* a number
* a string
* a list
* and a boolean

#### what is a number?

a way to store integer and decimal numbers

### what is a string?

a fancy way to say "text"
