1: in interpreter.py, around line 1977, create a function called execute_[function_name] (self, exec_ctx):

2: then, create the function body (what it will do).

3: then, at the return part of the function, if its not an error, write:
RTResult.success(what to return)

if is an error, write:

RTResult().failure(RTError(self.pos_start, self.pos_end,(error description),exec_ctx))

4: then, in the big block below, write:

BuiltInFunction.(function_name) = BuiltInFunction("functionName") #camel case for at least not so cringe code

5: then before the run function, there is another block of code, write:

global_symbol_table.set("functionName", BuiltInFunction.(function_name))
